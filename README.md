## Requirements

 - MsBuild (included with Visual Studio)
 - Xamarin Project with UI/Unit Test Projects within a git repository in your system.
 - UITest project with a real device configured (e.g: check Test.Cs section in http://sebacabrera.com/automated-xamarin-ui-tests-and-recorder/)
 - Add xunit console package in your UnitTest project - by Package
   Manager in VS or https://www.nuget.org/packages/xunit.runner.console
 - NUnit Console for Windows - http://nunit.org/download/
 - Git Bash - https://git-for-windows.github.io/

<br/>

## Pre-Configuration

#### If you have never compile your solution on this machine, do it!
NuGet packages should be in the file system so be sure they were restored after building. [Enabling and disabling package restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-restore#enabling-and-disabling-package-restore).

#### Git Bash
If you have not used the bash, please login with your credentials because they will be needed later to get the last version of the tests.

#### NUnit Console
Give read/write permission to TestResult.xml (located into NUnit console folder) 

#### xUnit doesnÂ´t need configuration

<br/>

## Setup

Complete your project path in **pull-git-repo.sh**
```bash
...
cd /e/Projects/MyProject
...
```

<br/>

Complete project name and paths in **StartTesting.bat**
```bash
...
REM *** VARs declarations - REQUIRED! ***
SET projectName=MyProject

SET androidProjectFilePath=E:\Projects\MyProject\MyProject\MyProject.Droid\MyProject.Droid.csproj

SET xunitPath=E:\Projects\MyProject\packages\xunit.runner.console.2.2.0\tools
SET unitTestProjectFilePath=E:\Projects\MyProject\Test\MyProject.UnitTest\MyProject.UnitTest.csproj
SET unitTestReleaseLibraryPath=E:\Projects\MyProject\Test\MyProject.UnitTest\bin\Release\MyProject.UnitTest.dll

SET nunitPath=C:\Program Files (x86)\NUnit.org\nunit-console
SET uITestProjectFilePath=E:\Projects\MyProject\Test\MyProject.UITest\MyProject.UITest.csproj
SET uiTestReleaseLibraryPath=E:\Projects\MyProject\Test\MyProject.UITest\bin\Release\MyProject.UITest.dll
...
```

<br/>

## Running Test Process

Open Run.bat and the process will be the next:

* Git Pull on the current branch of the project
* Build Android project (If your git pulls take much longer time,you can increase the waiting time for compiling Androind: into Run.bat - line 10)
* Build UnitTest project
* Build UITest project
* Open xUnit Console and run Unit tests
* Run UI tests in the connected device

<br/>

## Clarifications

This tool works with only one project. You should create folders with those scritps as projects you have.
  
Based on the requirement number 3, UI tests will run in one physical device (previously configured in the UI Test project).
